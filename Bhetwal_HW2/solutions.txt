Q: What are the things needed for Bootstrap to be loaded?
A: In order for Bootstrap to be loaded, we must first link the Bootstrap cascading style 
sheet using <link> within the head (<head>) of our code before anything else so we are able to first specify the CSS that we will use. 
Then, JavaScript is a requirement for these components to work so we need jQuery, Popper.js, 
and then JavaScript plugins all immediately before the closing </body> tag in our code 
so that they are enabled. If they are not in this order, they will not be enabled. 

Q: How does Bootstrap’s Grid system work? 
(Please do not copy and paste the answer from the official website, 
you are required to explain it in your own words. 
Feel free to use analogies if it makes things easier!)
A: A Bootstrap grid system works by using a library of HTML and CSS elements such 
that developers are able to easily place their website content where they want on 
their site. We can think of graph paper to understand this. Graph paper has both 
horizontal and vertical lines such that when they intersect, create squares. 
We can think of the Bootstrap grid system as the same. The Bootstrap 
grid system creates rows and columns where we have "squares" that form. 
Then, we can place the content we want in these "squares". 
In the Bootstrap grid system, we may have a maximum of 12 columns and unlimited rows.
